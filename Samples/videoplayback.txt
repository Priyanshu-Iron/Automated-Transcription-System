 Skull Candy Crusher 2 or Sonic Lamp Headphones. Starting with fit and comfort, I have to say the crusher is better. The Sonic Lamp 1 is a bit tighter, so it's comparatively less comfortable. The Crusher's do have ANC, the Sonic Lamp 1 does not. But honestly, I didn't notice much of a difference with ANC on and off, so the lack of ANC shouldn't really be a deal breaker. Both these headphones have some vibrations, but the Crusher's vibrate a lot more. Talking about sound quality itself, the crusher's were surprisingly good, but the Sonic Lamp headphones have a wider sound stage. For instance, if you're listening to an orchestra, you can clearly tell apart the instruments a bit better on the Sonic Lamp 1. Without those vibrations, the crusher becomes a fairly average headphone for that price. But the Sonic Lamp 1 in this port gives you a really flat sound output. So you could use these as, say, our reference headphone or an on-eared monitor. Overall, if you just listen to bass heavy music and want a headphone that rumbles a lot, then get the crusher. But if you want an all-rounder headphone that can handle anything, not just bass bails, then consider Sonic Lamp.
